          <h2>Turing's sunflower</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <p>In a letter to the zoologist J.Z. Young, British mathematician Alan Turing
              announced that his theory of embriology could explain, among other things,               the connection between leaf arrangements and Fibonacci numbers.</p>

            <p>A sequence of integers \(d_1,\dots,d_n\) is called graphical if there
              exists a graph \(G\) with it as its degree sequence. A theorem by Erd≈ës and
              Gallai characterizes which sequences are graphical, but gives no algorithm
              to explicitly construct such a graph. Can <em>you</em> construct it?</p>

          <h2>Who killed the Duke of Densmore?</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <p>One day Sherlock Holmes received the visit of his friend Watson,
              who was asked to investigate on a murder that had gone unsolved
              for more than ten years. At the time, the Duke of Densmore had
              been killed by a bomb powerful enough to destroy the castle where
              he had been living since retirement.</p>

          <h2>Four-coloring a Dodecahedron</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <p>By the Four color theorem, the faces of a dodecahedron are
              four-colorable; that is, one can pick a color among four for each
              face in such a way that no two adjacent faces share the same color.
              But can <em>you</em> find such a coloration?</p>
